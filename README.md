Data Bootcamp Week Two VBA

The purpose of the homework was to showcase that we can successfully use VBA to analyze the stock data given to us, and to loop that code through each worksheet in the workbook.

I did this by working step by step, creating my first batch of variables and my initial loop, building the loop and my variables, adding additional code (mainly if statements needed for new variables and headers), as I progressed. Finally, I looped through all worksheets, and formatted my percents correctly, debugging anything that wasn't working correctly in my transferred code from alphabetical testing to multiple year stock data.
